\begin{thm}[Euclid]
    There are infinitely many primes.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_n$ are all of the primes.
    Let $P = 1 + \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$ and let $p$ be a prime dividing $P$.

    Then $p$ can not be any of $p_i$, for otherwise $p$ would divide the
    difference $P - \left(\prod_{i=1}^n p_i \right) - 1$, which is impossible.
    So this prime $p$ is still another prime, and $p_1, p_2, \dots p_n$
    cannot be all of the primes.
\end{proof}
