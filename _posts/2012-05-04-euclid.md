To test the combination of mathjax and jekyll, a small "hello-world" proof is appropriate.


#### Theorem 1 (Euclid)

> There are infinitely many primes.


#### Proof

Suppose that $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_n$ are all of the primes.
Let $P = 1 + \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$ and let $p$ be a prime dividing $P$.

Then $p$ can not be any of $p_i$, for otherwise $p$ would divide the
difference $P - \left(\prod_{i=1}^n p_i \right) - 1$, which is impossible.
So this prime $p$ is still another prime, and $p_1, p_2, \dots p_n$
cannot be all of the primes.
